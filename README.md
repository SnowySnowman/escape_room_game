My first text-based escape room game. Credits to project partner Victoria

- When the player decides to wait for five times in a row, the game ends and the player is given an option to play again.
- Using Boolean variables and scanner library, the player should be able to decide which item to use.
- When the game ends with any sort of endings, the game shows what sort of result the player got (satisfactory or unsatisfactory) and shows how many ending the player has experienced so far if the player wishes to view it.
- When the player types in unexpected or invalid answer, it should show a message "invalid input" or other messages containing the same meaning.
- After every ending, the game should print out the corresponding ending dialogue, also, there should be an option for restarting the game.
- When the game restarts, it should skip the game asking for the user's name.
- The game should store volatile data (data disappears once player stops the game from running in the terminal) of the player, so that they can see how many other endings are left for them to find out.
- When the player picks up the shovel, the player’s attack has to increase by 30, which makes it 50 in total.
- The background music of the game will be played throughout the game.
- For the fighting scenes in the neighbour’s house and hospital, the enemies’ names would be randomised, in the barrier of 5 names in total for each entity.
